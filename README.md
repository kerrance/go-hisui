# Hisui

Search for and display information about a Pokémon.

All Pokémon information is retrieved from [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

For now, this application will only run locally on your device. In the future, I would like to provide an easier method
for running this application.

# How to run

Firstly, you will need to [install Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) on your device. Secondly, you will need to download
the files from this repository to your device, I recommend you use Git by running
`git clone git@github.com:kerrance/go-hisui.git`.

You can then boot up your Terminal and navigate to the directory folder. You will then be able to run `go run main.go`
to start the application in your terminal window.
